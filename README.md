#ajax-github-finder

Use UIKit CSS

An info app to find github users info, repos, etc.

Uses some jQuery ajax calls and returns 5 recent repos of user and other details.

Also serves as a useful local reference to the UIKit framework with (in main nav and mobile nav slideout (off canvas element) from docs.

Rerences most of the components. :)

All files included just run index.html
